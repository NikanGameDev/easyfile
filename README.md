Welcome to EazyFile!
** Not to be confused with SARS e@zyFileâ„¢  **
EazyFile is a python module by Nikan which lets you make files easily without no need for code such as:

    with open("filepath", "wt") as f:
        f.write("text")
But code like:
`import easyfile
easyfile.write("path goes here", "text goes here")`
or code like:
`import easyfile
easyfile.writebytes("path goes here", #Bytes go here (images, videos etc.))`
or also code like:
`import easyfile
easyfile.read("path goes here")`
Using open() is boring to me too, but now that EasyFile exists there's no need.
