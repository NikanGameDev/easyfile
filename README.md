Welcome to EasyFile!
** Not to be confused with SARS e@zyFileâ„¢  **
EazyFile is a python module made by me which lets you make files easily without no need for code such as:

    with open("filepath", "wt") as f:
        f.write("text")
But code like:
`easyfile.write("path goes here", "text goes here")`
Makes it so much easier!
